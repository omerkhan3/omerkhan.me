<p id="aboutme_paragraph"> Hi there, and thanks for stumbling upon my website!  My name is Omer Khan, and I am from West Bloomfield, Michigan.   I am currently a junior at Wayne State University in Detroit, MI pursuing a B.A. in Computer Science with a Minor in Economics.  I am an aspiring software engineer who loves to use code to make life a little bit easier for everyone!  I have strong interest in mobile/web application development and product management long term.  Previously, I have done internships at Hewlett Packard Enterprise (Web Development) and Perficient (QA testing) and am on the lookout for my next big challenge!  When I am not coding, you will likely find me playing basketball at the local rec center, watching the latest and greatest movies, trying to become good at table tennis, or outdoors exploring new areas.   A goal of mine outside of my career is to travel and see as much of the world as possible!     </p></div>
